# Statement of need

There is not an R software package currently available that allows to calculate and predict LDL Cholesterol through equation and machine learning methods.
LDL cholesterol is responsible for many important diseases. The accure compute of LDL includes high cost and oft technical difficulties(ultracentrifugation).
The ``LDlcalc`` package offer a wide variety of ways to calculate or predict the Low Density Lipoprotein values of patients based on the values of three other metrics as Total Cholesterol, Triglyceride and High Density Lipoprotein.
